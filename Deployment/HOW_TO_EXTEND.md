# How to Extend 

There are opportunities to extend the capabilities of this solution accelerator or apply the same architecture to solve a different business problem. Below are a few examples: 

- Modify the Agent Meta prompt by adding requirement that it must produce RFP responses using the original FRP tabular format and address each requirement in the response. 
- Modify the Agent meta prompt for different business requirements and supply the relevant training samples as knowledge for the agent. 
- Enhance the word template to introduce multiple variables to generate richer content. 
- Integrate with additional system of records like Dynamics 365, Salesforce to retrieve customer accounts. Use the information to generate more relevant RFP responses.
